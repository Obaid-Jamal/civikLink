CivicLink - Citizen Issue Reporting Platform
CivicLink is a web-based portal designed to bridge the gap between citizens and municipal authorities. It empowers users to report local civic issues, such as potholes, broken streetlights, or sanitation problems, directly to the concerned departments. The platform includes separate, feature-rich dashboards for both citizens and administrators to ensure transparent tracking and efficient resolution of reported problems.

The entire application runs on the front-end using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, with all data managed through the browser's localStorage, making it a lightweight and serverless project.
